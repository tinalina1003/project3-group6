summary:
city of london highest accident per population and area ratio because low number of residents


keep in mind it could also be people who are passing by the boroughs that cause accidents so it's not 100% indicative of the safety of city of london.

however, still the highest accidents/sq.km in london with 220 accidents/sq.km

bromley lowest accidents/sq.km
